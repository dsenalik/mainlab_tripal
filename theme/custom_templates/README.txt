You can copy default templates and/or preprocessors here and modify their code  to 
change their corresponding pages. You need to enable the 'custom_templates' in the 
mainlab_tripal administrative interface.

Alternatively, you can create your own folder in the 'theme' folder to store  your own 
templates/preprocessors. The default template/preprocessor will be overriden if the file
found in your folder has the same name. Still, you'll need to enable your templates in the
mainlab_tripal administrative interface.
