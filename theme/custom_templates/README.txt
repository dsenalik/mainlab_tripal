You can copy default templates and/or preprocessors here and modify their code  to 
change their corresponding pages. You need to enable the 'custom_templates' from the 
mainlab_tripal administrative interface.

Alternatively, you can create your own sub-folder in the 'theme' folder to store  your own 
templates/preprocessors. The default template/preprocessor will be overriden if the file
found in your folder has the same name. Still, you'll need to enable your theme which has 
the same name as your sub-folder in the mainlab_tripal administrative interface.
